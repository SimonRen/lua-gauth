## functions

### GAuth.Check(string secretKey, string input)

#### Parameters

**input** - The 6-digit code generated by the app to test against the secret

#### Returns

**Bool isValid** - True if the code is valid, false if it not

### GAuth.GenCode(string secretKey, int time)

#### Parameters

**secretKey** - The secret that is shared to the user for entry into the Google Authenticator app

**time** - The time the code was generated. Normally found with `math.floor(os.time()/30)`

```lua
local input = "172832" -- What the user gives you. The code from the Google Authenticator app
local secretKey = "TESTtestTESTtest" -- The secret which is given to the user to input into the Google Authenticator app
if GAuth.Check(secretKey, input) then
  print "Pass"
else
  print "Bad code"
end
```
